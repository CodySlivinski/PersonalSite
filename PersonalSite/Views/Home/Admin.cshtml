                        <p>
                            This project was done using pair programming. Here my fellow classmate Devon and I used MVC archtitecture to develope an application for a school to be able to enroll students into classes. The purpose of this project was to again hone in on .NET Core and MVC pricipals but also learning to program in a small team. Using  "driver", "navigator" roles Devon and I developed this app in a short week of class. The application has full functionality for shcedulers to go in and enroll students into classes. Becuase of the indentity authorization that we set up with the app schedulers and admininstrators were allowed different functionallity through the app. Here Devon and I spent the week creating a fun school based on the Guild of Theives to teach younglings to become master thieves.
